# What is Thumper?
Thumper is a simple and very light responsive grid system built with speed and simplicity in mind.

## What is planned?
Right now, pending any crazy ideas that might pop into my head, I plan on building a plugin for thumper that has some prestyled badass-ness. 

## Examples of this in use?
Sure! I can't guarantee how these perform or look because I don't maintain them, but they're sites built using Thumper.
